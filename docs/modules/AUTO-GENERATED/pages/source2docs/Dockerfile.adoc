Dockerfile for generating AsciiDoc Documentation based on inline documentation.

== Overview

This Dockerfile is designed to generate AsciiDoc documentation for a
specific Antora module based on inline documentation from Dockerfiles, Bash scripts,
and GitHub Actions workflows.

The generated documentation provides a comprehensive guide for developers and users,
enhancing the understanding of the codebase and facilitating smoother collaboration.

NOTE: This image is intentionally running as root to make sure it can be used inside
Github Actions workflows without permission errors.

== How to use this image
To use the image run the following command from a bash file.

[source, bash]

----
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"  --volume /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro  --volume /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro  --volume "$(pwd):/project"  --workdir "/project"  sommerfeldio/source2docs:latest
----

NOTE: Run this image from the root of your project. Do not change the volume bind from
`/project` to anything else because the scripts inside the action expect this folder
to exist and to contain your projects data.
