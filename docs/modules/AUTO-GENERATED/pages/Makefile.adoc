= Makefile

Lint this repository and build all Docker images.

== Overview

This Makefile helps maintain code quality by using linters consistent
with our GitHub Actions, and it ensures the Dockerfiles are properly structured and
meet standards using Hadolint before creating Docker images from the repository.

== How to use this Makefile

The default target, which is triggered when simply using `make` build all Docker
images from this repository.

=== `make test`

This target runs the same linters as the GitHub Actions workflow. By applying these
linters, it ensures the code in the repository meets quality standards and follows
best practices.

=== `make build`

The target handles the process of building Docker images from the repository. Before
building the Docker images, the Makefile verifies the Dockerfiles using Hadolint.
Hadolint is a linter specifically designed for Dockerfiles. It checks for adherence
to best practices and potential issues in the Dockerfile syntax and structure.
