== About this project
In standard practice, individual Docker images would typically have their own dedicated repositories and distinct versioning. However, in this particular case, the decision to consolidate these images within a single repository is based on a combination of factors.

Foremost, it's worth noting that the initial setup phase is expected to conclude with relatively few releases in the foreseeable future. This projection supports the rationale behind merging the images into a common repository, although this approach results in all images receiving new version tags even if only one has been modified.

* Where to file issues -> {url-project}/issues

== Docker Images
The Visual Studio Code Dev Containers extension lets you use a container as a full-featured development environment. It allows you to open any folder inside (or mounted into) a container and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set. This lets VS Code provide a local-quality development experience including full IntelliSense (completions), code navigation, and debugging regardless of where your tools (or code) are located.

This repository also is a compilation of Docker images primed for utilization within GitHub Actions workflows (although standalone usage is also possible).
