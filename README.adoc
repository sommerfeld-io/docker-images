== About this project
In standard practice, individual Docker images would typically have their own dedicated repositories and distinct versioning. However, in this particular case, the decision to consolidate these images within a single repository is based on a combination of factors.

Foremost, it's worth noting that the initial setup phase is expected to conclude with relatively few releases in the foreseeable future. This projection supports the rationale behind merging the images into a common repository, although this approach results in all images receiving new version tags even if only one has been modified.

* Github Repository -> {url-project}
* Where to file issues -> {url-project}/issues
