== About this project
In standard practice, individual Docker images would typically have their own dedicated repositories and distinct versioning. However, in this particular case, the decision to consolidate these images within a single repository is based on a combination of factors.

Foremost, it's worth noting that the initial setup phase is expected to conclude with relatively few releases in the foreseeable future. This projection supports the rationale behind merging the images into a common repository, although this approach results in all images receiving new version tags even if only one has been modified.

* Github Repository -> {url-project}
* Where to file issues -> {url-project}/issues

== Docker Images
The Visual Studio Code Dev Containers extension lets you use a container as a full-featured development environment. It allows you to open any folder inside (or mounted into) a container and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set. This lets VS Code provide a local-quality development experience including full IntelliSense (completions), code navigation, and debugging regardless of where your tools (or code) are located.

* https://hub.docker.com/r/sommerfeldio/devcontainer-ubuntu

This repository also is a compilation of Docker images primed for utilization within GitHub Actions workflows (although standalone usage is also possible).

=== About the tags and versions
include::ROOT:partial$/docker-tag-strategy.adoc[]

=== devcontainer-go
This Docker image symbolizes the development environment container for any projects employing link:https://go.dev[Golang]. It derives from Microsoft's official Go devcontainer image but some includes supplementary tools. The purpose of this image is to function as a devcontainer within Visual Studio Code and is not meant to be utilized independently.

This image is link:https://hub.docker.com/r/sommerfeldio/devcontainer-go[published to DockerHub] as `sommerfeldio/devcontainer-go`.

[source, json]
....
{
    "name": "Go",
    "image": "sommerfeldio/devcontainer-go:latest",

    "features": {
         "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2": {}
    },

    "postCreateCommand": "pre-commit install"
}
....

=== devcontainer-ubuntu
The Docker image is configured to serve as a development environment ("devcontainer"), making it easy for developers to work on projects without worrying about setting up dependencies and tools locally. This image uses Ubuntu as the base operating system and includes pre-commit, a tool used for managing and maintaining pre-commit hooks (e.g. to run validations before pushing data to a remote repository).

This image is link:https://hub.docker.com/r/sommerfeldio/devcontainer-ubuntu[published to DockerHub] as `sommerfeldio/devcontainer-ubuntu`.

[source, json]
....
{
    "name": "Ubuntu",
    "image": "sommerfeldio/devcontainer-ubuntu:latest",

    "features": {
         "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2": {}
    },

    "postCreateCommand": "pre-commit install"
}
....


=== folderslint
The `link:https://hub.docker.com/r/sommerfeldio/folderslint[sommerfeldio/folderslint]` image is a utility Docker image used in Github Actions workflows to validate the directory structure of a project. The image ships with link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/folderslint[folderslint].

[source, bash]
....
docker run -it --rm --volume "$(pwd):$(pwd)" --workdir "$(pwd)" sommerfeldio/folderslint:latest folderslint
....

To use in a Github Actions workflow, use the following snippet.

[source, yaml]
....
lint-folders:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Run folderslint in container
      run: docker run -i --rm --volume "$(pwd):$(pwd)" --workdir "$(pwd)" sommerfeldio/folderslint:latest folderslint
....

=== ftp-client
The `link:https://hub.docker.com/r/sommerfeldio/ftp-client[sommerfeldio/ftp-client]` image ships with NCFTP and uses link:https://www.ncftp.com/ncftp/doc/ncftpput.html[ncftpput] for FTP uploads and downloads.

[source, bash]
....
FTP_HOST="ftp-host.example.com"
FTP_USER="the_username"
FTP_PASS="the_password"

echo "Upload via FTP"
docker run -i --rm \
    --volume "$(pwd):$(pwd)" \
    --workdir "$(pwd)" \
    sommerfeldio/ftp-client:latest ncftpput -R -v -u "$FTP_USER" -p "$FTP_PASS" "$FTP_HOST" / *
....

=== jq
The `link:https://hub.docker.com/r/sommerfeldio/jq[sommerfeldio/jq]` image ships with link:https://stedolan.github.io/jq[jq] which is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

=== source2docs
The `link:https://hub.docker.com/r/sommerfeldio/jq[sommerfeldio/source2docs]` image is designed to generate AsciiDoc documentation for a specific Antora module based on inline documentation from Dockerfiles, Bash scripts, and GitHub Actions workflows. The generated documentation provides a comprehensive guide for developers and users, enhancing the understanding of the codebase and facilitating smoother collaboration.

[source, bash]
----
docker run --rm \
    --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    --volume /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro \
    --volume /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
    --volume "$(pwd):/project" \
    --workdir "/project" \
    sommerfeldio/source2docs:latest
----

NOTE: Run this image from the root of your project. Do not change the volume bind from `/project` to anything else because the scripts inside the action expect this folder to exist and to contain your projects data.

=== terraform
Run `terraform` commands without installing Terraform onto any machine. The only dependency is link:https://www.docker.com[Docker]. The image ships with some addtional software like the link:https://bitwarden.com/help/cli[Bitwarden CLI] which is needed for the link:https://registry.terraform.io/providers/maxlaverse/bitwarden/latest/docs[Terraform Bitwarden Provider] to work.

This project is used for my link:https://github.com/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/configs/actions/workflows/configure-github.yml[Global: Apply Github Configuration] pipeline. The pipeline ensures a consistent Github configuration and all configuration for all repositories.

Use this command to run the image as a non-root user (pass the current user of the host into the container). This is tested on Ubuntu 22.04. This example needs three environment variables `TV_VAR_bw_*` for the Bitwarden CLI (which is used by the link:https://registry.terraform.io/providers/maxlaverse/bitwarden/latest/docs[Terraform Bitwarden Provider]) to work. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is needed for the link:https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github/latest/docs[Terraform Github Provider]. Adjust the environment variables according to your needs.

[source, bash]
----
docker run --rm \
    --volume /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro \
    --volume /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \
    --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    --volume /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro \
    --volume /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
    --volume "$(pwd):$(pwd)" \
    --workdir "$(pwd)" \
    --env "GITHUB_TOKEN=$TOKEN" \
    --env "TF_VAR_bw_client_id=$BW_CLIENT_ID" \
    --env "TF_VAR_bw_client_secret=$BW_CLIENT_SECRET" \
    --env "TF_VAR_bw_password=$BW_MASTER_PASS" \
    sommerfeldio/terraform:latest apply -auto-approve
